## **Top-down learning path: Machine Learning for Software Engineers**

Inspired by https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers, https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university and many great one before me.

How I (Tu Anh) plan to become a Financial Engineer


## ***What do I have for you ?***

This is my long-term study plan for going from Equity Analyst to Financial/Machine Learning Engineer (self-taught, no CS degree) through real-life problem and top-ranked course from US (ref below)

My main goal was to find an approach to studying Financial Engineer that is mainly hands-on and abstracts most of the Math for the beginner. This approach is unconventional because itâ€™s the top-down and results-first approach designed for Financial Engineers.

In investing, there are two simply way for you to get your alpha , you have more information networking with big player in the market or you processing the data you have faster. I choose the latte and I want all of you to be a part of my journey.

Please, feel free to make any contributions and feedback.
